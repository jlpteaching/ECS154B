# Extra credit opportunities

Since this is the first time we are using these assignments, we want to offset some of the pain that comes with new assignments by offering a variety of opportunities for extra credit.

Check this page often.
There may be more that appear, or some that are claimed by classmates.

For cases where a finite number exist, you may work together with a group and the points will be split between the group members.


| | | Number available |
|-|-|-|
| Find a bug and report it | 5 points on the assignment | ∞ |
| Fix a bug it, open a pull request, and it is committed | 10 points on the assignment | ∞ |
| Create a better logo (I the current one) | 0.2 points *on final grade* | 1 |
| Implement a visualizer (ask for details) | 1.0 point *on final grade* | 1 |
| Improve the debug viewer | 0.5 points *on final grade* | 1 |
