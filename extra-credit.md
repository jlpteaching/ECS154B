## Rules for receiving extra credit

1. You must use GitHub for reporting and fixing bugs/errors
2. You must use your *real name* on GitHub.

  If you log into GitHub and select "settings" from the menu under your avatar in the top right you can set your name.
  It's important to use your *real name* (or the name that you go by) and not a handle because your GitHub profile is a professional profile of yourself.

3. After your issue has been acknowledge or your PR merged, fill out the "extra credit" assignment [on Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/105214/assignments/420029). You will not get the extra credit if you don't fill out one of the forms on this assignment. Make sure to include a link to the issue/PR to get the full credit.
