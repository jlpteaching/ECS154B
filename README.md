### Instructor

**Professor Jason Lowe-Power** (<jlowepower@ucdavis.edu>)

Please contact me via email if you have a personal request, *not* canvas messages.
I do not check canvas messages.
For class-wide questions (e.g., anything more than one person might be interested to know), please use the [online discussion](https://campuswire.com/c/GDBEBE971).

[*Office Hours*](https://ucdaviscoe.zoom.us/my/jlowepower): Tuesdays from 4:30-5:30, or by appointment.

These office hours can be used to discuss anything you would like.
The discussion topic doesn't have to be class related or even computer architecture related.
If you need to discuss something in private, let me know (e.g., via chat on zoom) and I can create a waiting room for others while we talk privately.

*Office Location*: Use the [Zoom link](https://ucdaviscoe.zoom.us/my/jlowepower) (<https://ucdaviscoe.zoom.us/my/jlowepower>) to join during office hours.

Please suggest a meeting time when you email me for an appointment.
You can use [my calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=jlowepower%40ucdavis.edu&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) to quickly find a time I am available.
It's not guaranteed to be completely up-to-date, but it gives a good starting point.

Normally my office location is 3049 Kemper Hall, but now it's home with my cats!

## Student Support

As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation.
These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a studentâ€™s ability to participate in daily activities.
UC Davis is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students.
If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.
You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via [Student Health and Counseling Services](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/).

You can also contact me during office hours, via email, or by making a separate office hour appointment: [jlowepower@ucdavis.edu](mailto:jlowepower@ucdavis.edu).
