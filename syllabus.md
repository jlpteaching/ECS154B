## Important Information

### Time and Location

*Lecture*: **ONLINE**

All lectures will be conducted asynchronously via recorded video.
Videos for the next week will normally be available at the end of the previous week.
See the [class materials](../materials/index.md) for all of the lecture videos.

*Discussion*: **ONLINE**. See [Discussion](#discussion) for more information.

Discussion will take place online via Zoom.
See the [Discussion section](#discussion) of the syllabus for more details.

### Instructor

**Professor Jason Lowe-Power** (<jlowepower@ucdavis.edu>).

I prefer Jason, but will likely respond if you say "professor \<something\>".
My pronouns are he/him/his.

Please contact me via email if you have a personal request, *not* canvas messages.
I do not check canvas messages.
For class-wide questions (e.g., anything more than one person might be interested to know), please use the [online discussion](#discussion).

#### Office hours

[*Office Hours*](https://ucdaviscoe.zoom.us/my/jlowepower): Tuesdays from 4:30-5:30, or by appointment.

These office hours can be used to discuss anything you would like.
The discussion topic doesn't have to be class related or even computer architecture related.
If you need to discuss something in private, let me know (e.g., via chat on zoom) and I can create a waiting room for others while we talk privately.

*Office Location*: Use the [Zoom link](https://ucdaviscoe.zoom.us/my/jlowepower) (<https://ucdaviscoe.zoom.us/my/jlowepower>) to join during office hours.

Please suggest a meeting time when you email me for an appointment.
You can use [my calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=jlowepower%40ucdavis.edu&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) to quickly find a time I am available.
It's not guaranteed to be completely up-to-date, but it gives a good starting point.

Normally my office location is 3049 Kemper Hall, but now it's home with my cats!

### Teaching Assistant

**Julian Angeles** (jtangeles@ucdavis.edu )

*Office Hours*: Thursdays from 9:00-10:00 A.M.

*Office Location*: [Zoom link](https://ucdaviscoe.zoom.us/my/jtoya) (<https://ucdaviscoe.zoom.us/my/jtoya>)

### Discussion

Since this quarter will be all online learning, we will be conducting discussion online as well.
The information here may change as we work out the most effective way to use everyone's time.

We will be using discussions to reinforce the lectures and help out with the assignments.
**You are required to attend one discussion each week.**
See [the participation section below](#participation) for more info.

There will be six discussion times each with 10-15 people assigned to attend.
You will be able to sign up for your preferred discussion time during the first week of class.

#### Discussion times and locations

* *Discussion 1*: Tuesday 10:30am-11:10am

  * [Zoom link](https://ucdaviscoe.zoom.us/j/575347577) <https://ucdaviscoe.zoom.us/j/575347577>

Please register for a discussion time on [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10cJu_150qJbxrKf4QzPYfvW-MSOis88HVW5jzFo8BXI/edit?usp=sharing).
Do your best to evenly sign up for times.
I believe having fewer people in each discussion will help everyone be able to participate and learn better.

I would prefer that you attend the same time each week, but this is not a requirement.
Either Julian and I will attend every discussion.

#### Discussion etiquette

You may be new to participating in remote meetings this quarter.
While I'm new to remote teaching, I've been working in distributed environments for years, so remote meetings are the norm for me.
Below are some common etiquette ideas that I've found work well when participating in remote meetings.

* **Be patient.** Remote meetings introduce communication *latency* and *synchronization* issues (things we'll be learning about this this class, BTW). Please be patient with everyone. This often means pausing for longer than you think is necessary when talking, putting up with minor annoyances (e.g., someone interrupting you), and putting up with poor connections.
* **Mute your microphone unless you are speaking.** All too often there is feedback between microphones and speakers. Often, you can't tell that it's your computer that's causing feedback issues for everyone else. Also, I've experienced other people in the local environment causing distractions when they don't mean (e.g., my cat likes to meow at me while I'm talking sometimes).
* **State your name when you speak.** Please state your name before you ask a question/speak. For instance "Hi, this is Jason, why is pipelining so amazing?"
* **Set your full name in zoom.** Click the "participants button at the bottom, then click "more" next your name. From there you can rename yourself.
* **Stay engaged.** Don't open up other programs/internet/reddit, etc.
* **Use the raise hand feature.** This way I can recognize that you would like to speak. This is also under the "participants" menu in zoom.
* **(Try to) Enable video.** If your bandwidth supports it and you have a webcam, everyone will be more engaged if you can see each others' faces. Using the "gallery view" on zoom allows you to see everyone at once. The option is in the upper right (not speaker view). If you're experiencing lag or poor connection, you can disable video to try to improve your experience.
* **Use the phone if you have a poor connection.** The zoom invite link will have a phone number that you can call into. You can log into the computer and disable audio and video then use the phone to call in.
* **Don't use the virtual background.** This is a "cool" feature, but it's distracting to all others.

## Class Resources

### Online material

All of the material for this course is online.
We will use [GitHub](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS154B) as the main website and entry point for all course information.
The version of documents found on GitHub are the canonical versions of all documents.
Other downloaded versions of documents may become out of date.
If I make changes to those documents, they will appear first on GitHub.

GitHub will contain this document and [the material](../materials/index.md) for the class.
This will also include links to all of the lecture videos and quizzes.

### Gradescope

We will use [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/105214) for all assignments including lab submissions and returning quizzes, the midterm, and the final.
Gradescope gives you a graded PDF version of your test, along with a rubric, immediately after we're done grading.
You will receive an email from Gradescope to make your account early in the quarter.

All lab assignments will be autograded by Gradescope.
When you upload your code to Gradescope, a set of tests will be run on it and your grade *will be immediately available*.
You may submit your code any number of times.
Only the final submission will be accepted as the grade for your assignment.
However, if you submit after the deadline, the [late policy](#late-assignments) applies.

### Online discussions

We will use [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/GDBEBE971/) for class discussions outside of the classroom.
If you haven't used Campuswire before, it's a cool tool that is essentially a message board for the class.
It is a much more polished and modern website compared to Piazza.
Both the TAs and I will be on Campuswire to answer questions.

It's best to ask your questions on Campuswire.
That way, all of your classmates can see the answer instead of emailing the TAs or me.
Additionally, you might get a much faster response from one of your classmates!
Through asking and answering questions on Campuswire, you improve your understanding of the material, and improve other students' understanding as well.

In the spirit of the above, please ask questions as public questions on Campuswire, if possible.
This way, your question, and the answer to your question, can help somebody else who might have the same question.
We will change questions asked privately to public, if we deem it appropriate.
If your question involves code you've written, or is about a personal issue, we will leave those private.

### Regrade Requests

Regrade requests must be made within one week of the return of the assignment or test.
Regrade requests should be made in person (online), in (online) office hours or by appointment.

### Accommodations

The exam schedule is available on the [materials page](../materials/index.md).
Per official UC Davis policy, if you have an accommodation request from the [Student Disability Center](https://sdc.ucdavis.edu/), or have any conflicts with exam times for religious observances, you must notify me **by the fourth class, April 9, 2020**.
If you do not notify me by this time, I cannot guarantee I will be able to make the accommodation.

For **each** test, quiz, etc. you must reach out to me *one week in advance* to schedule specific accommodations for that test, quiz, etc.
If you do not notify me by this time, I cannot guarantee I will be able to make the accommodation.

## Academic Misconduct

Academic misconduct is a serious issue.
You can find the official UC Davis policy on the [Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs](http://sja.ucdavis.edu/) website.

You are expected to *cite all of the work you reference*.
Any ideas that are not specifically yours or generally known (e.g., caches hold data) should have a citation.
When in doubt, cite.

You may not, under any circumstances, post the code you write publicly.
This means you *cannot create public forks* of the template code repository.
If we find any of the class's code beyond the template files distributed, we will report this violation to SJA.

Any violations of this policy will result in reporting the violating student(s) to the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs.
This can result in a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class.
See the [Computer Science Department's policy](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/blog/academic-misconduct-policy/) for more information.

## Student Support

There is a lot of great information on the [Coronovirus Update Page](https://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/news/coronavirus-update) with extensive [FAQs](https://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/news/coronavirus-faqs) and specific [student support information](https://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/news/coronavirus-faqs#support) in this unique circumstance.

If you need access to computing resources, internet, etc. there's lots of good information on the [Keep Teaching webpage](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/student-resources).

As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation.
These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily activities.
UC Davis is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students.
If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.
You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via [Student Health and Counseling Services](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/).

You can also contact me during office hours, via email, or by making a separate office hour appointment: [jlowepower@ucdavis.edu](mailto:jlowepower@ucdavis.edu).
If you need additional accommodations due to these or other personal issues, don't hesitate to ask.
I cannot guarantee that I will be able to make accommodations.
However, reaching out to me earlier will increase the likelihood that I can make accommodations.

## Prerequisites

ECS 154A; or both EEC 170 and EEC 180A.

Although not an official prereq, this course requires experience with many programming tools (e.g., Linux, command line, git, etc.).
A good resource is a recent MIT course on "[The missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)" which teaches these important tools that aren't necessarily covered in a "normal" computer science curriculum.

## PTAs

Before asking for a PTA, be sure that you have read the [Department of Computer Science's PTA Policy](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/blog/pta-policy/).
PTA numbers will only be issued after the 12th day of instruction, and PTA numbers are only issued for extenuating circumstances related to graduation.

## Assignments and Tests

I understand the need for more flexibility this quarter.
Many of us will have responsibilities beyond just school since we are living at home.
I'm sure many of you will be taking care of loved ones, working, or have other responsibilities that may conflict with this class.
I will do everything I can to accommodate individual circumstances while maintaining fairness in the class.
The most important thing is that **the earlier you communicate with me the more likely I will be able to make accommodations**.
See also [student support](#student-support).

### Grading Breakdown

| Category      | Percentage |
|---------------|------------|
| Participation | 20%        |
| Project (5x)  | 40%        |
| Quizzes       | 20%        |
| Tests         | 20%        |

### Participation

I want to encourage participation in my classes.
I believe that learning is a two way street, and that it's important for you to participate to get the full learning experience.
Therefore, I encourage participation by making part of your grade dependent on it.

Since this quarter is all online, I am giving more weight than normal to participation.
This extra weight is for two reasons.
First, the "activation energy" required for participation will be higher, so I'm increasing the reward function to help encourage more participation.
Second, by adding more weight to participation, I am reducing the weight on tests.

20% of your grade comes from actively participating in class (defined broadly).
You are expected to participate on [online discussions](#online-discussions), [discussion section discussions](#discussions), **or** [office hours](#office-hours).

You are required to attend and participate (say something at least once) in one [discussion section](#discussions) each week.
We prefer you to attend the one you sign up for, but you can attend any.
Every week counts as two points on your final grade.
Thus, if you attend your discussion section each week, you will receive the full points for participation.

However, we understand that this won't necessarily be possible for everyone to attend every week.
Therefore, you you can also get participation points by using our [online discussion](#online-discussions).
Participating in [online discussion](#online-discussions) can earn you up to 5 points.
Importantly, we are looking for substantive contributions to online discussions.

Finally, you can also earn points by attending and participating in office hours.
For each office hour you attend (and we have a substantive conversation), you can earn one participation point up to 5 points.

### Project

You will complete five project-based assignments throughout this course.
The assignments can be found via the links below.
All together, the labs are worth 40% of your final grade.
Each lab is weighted based on the amount of time you are given to complete the lab.

Labs are due at 11:59 PM on the date listed below.

* [Assignment 1](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-1.md) (1.5 weeks, 10%). Due 4/10.
* [Assignment 2](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-2.md) (2 weeks, 10%). Due 4/17.
* [Assignment 3.1](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-3.md) (1 week, 5%). Due 4/24.
* [Assignment 3.2](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-3.md) (1 week, 5%). Due 5/8.
* [Assignment 4](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-4.md) (2 weeks, 10%). Due 5/25.
* [Assignment 5](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-5.md) (1.5 weeks, 10%). Due 6/8.

#### Late Assignments

If you turn in a project assignment late, you will lose points.
The percentage of points you will lose is given by the equation below.
This will give you partial points up to 72 hours after the due date and penalizes you less if you barely miss the deadline.

![Late policy latex code](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?fraction%5C%20of%5C%20points%20%3D%20-1%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7B%7Bhours%5C%20late%7D%5E2%7D%7B72%5E2%7D%20&plus;%201)

![Late policy graph](/img/late_policy.png)

Note: When submitting late, the reduction in points will not immediately appear in Gradescope.
Rest assured, we will go through and double check all of the submission times ;).

### Quizzes

There will be many quizzes throughout the quarter.
The purpose of these quizzes is to make sure you are keeping up with the lectures and you are learning the key ideas.
Roughly, there will be one after every video.
Expect 2-4 quizzes per week.

The quizzes are open book/notes/internet.
However, you *must* take the quiz on your own, and you cannot work together on the quizzes.

You are allowed any number of attempts on the quiz, and you will see which questions you get wrong each time you take it.

Quizzes are due about one week after the videos are released to give you ample time to watch the lecture video and take the quiz.
They are due at the time I expect you will finish watching the videos.
This is roughly when the lecture would have occurred if we were in person.

Due to the extenuating circumstances of this entire quarter, there will be no late penalty for any quiz.
However, submissions for quizzes will close one week after the due date.

Grades for quizzes will be released at the due date, and you can resubmit any questions you got wrong for full credit.
I strongly suggest taking the quiz before the due date and going back a couple of hours or days later to find out what you got wrong.
This will help with your comprehension.

### Tests

There will be two tests this quarter which together count for only 20% of your grade.
The tests will be after each of the two main modules, [processor architecture](../materials/processor/index.md), [memory architecture](../materials/memory/index.md), and [parallel architecture](../materials/parallel/index.md).

The tests will be administered on Gradescope.
You will be given a time limit of 2 hours to take the tests and a window of 1 day to take the test.

## Reading List and Schedule

### Textbook

In this class, we'll be closely following *Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface* by D. A. Patterson and J. L. Hennessy.

Importantly, you should get the *RISC-V edition*, not the ARM edition and not the MIPS edition. This is different from versions in years past.
The correct version is black with a picture of an abacus on a tablet.

To support remote instruction during Spring 2020, all textbooks available in digital format will be provided as e-books.
To access the e-books available for your courses, click on the BOOKSHELF option in the Canvas navigation menu.
You have Auto-Access for any required textbooks, but can opt out in the Bookshelf window if you make other arrangements for the text.

**IMPORTANT:** The textbook on Canvas/vitalsource is *opt out*.
Thus, if you don't want to be charged for the textbook you must *opt out* by 4/16/2020!

Additionally, you may find *The RISC-V Reader: An Open Architecture Atlas* a useful companion, but this book is not required.
We will be implementing a RISC-V processor in this class and having a physical book with the RISC-V instructions described will be useful.
If you prefer to not buy yet another book (though I do think it's a useful book to have), you can also use the online version of [the RISC-V specification](https://riscv.org/specifications/).
Note: the specification has fewer pretty pictures than the book.

You can find these books at the [university bookstore](http://ucdavisstores.com/SelectTermDept) or through various sites online.

### Schedule

See the [class materials](../materials/index.md) for due dates.
