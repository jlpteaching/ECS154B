![HBM memory]({{"/img/hbm.jpg" | relative_url }})

In this section, we're going to learn about what I believe is the most important part of the computer's architecture: the memory system.
Moving data from point A to point B is one of the main bottlenecks in all of today's systems.
Shown above is a picture of HBM (high-bandwidth memory) which is a relatively new memory technology primarily used in GPUs and other accelerators to try to overcome this memory bottleneck.

## Memory intro and Technology

In this section, we'll be talking about how memory *works* and [memory technology](../technology/).
We'll find that while there are many different memory technologies, none are "best".

## Caches and the Memory Hierarchy

Since no one technology is the best, we want to create a memory hierarchy with [caches](../caches/).
We will discuss the underlying principles that make caches efficient, and how hardware caches are designed.

### [Assignment 4](https://jlpteaching.github.io/dinocpu-wq21/assignments/assignment-4-bp.html) **DUE 2/28**

## Virtual memory

Finally, we'll step up a level and look at how operating systems allow multiple programs to share a single memory through [virtualization](../virtual/).
